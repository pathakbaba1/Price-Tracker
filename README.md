# A price tracker for e-commerce websites
I think we all are familiar with the feeling when we visit any e-commerce website to buy a product and it is out of our budget. At that moment we all wish to have someone or something who could tell us whenever the price goes down.

Here I have tried to build a similar kind of thing which will inform us through a mail whenever the price of desired product comes down the budget.

***Note:*** *This is a prototype which currently works only on Amazon.com but it can be easily modified to work on other e-commerce websites like Flipkart, Snapdeal, etc as well.*
